This file describe how I design and implement the NVM emulator

1. Design
   The emulator consist of only one kernel module which will create a kernel thread
   polling PMU counter that counts memory access. If the counter has value greater
   than certain value predefined, the kernel thread would generate an IPI to
   interrupt the excution of a process on certain CPU (cpu 12 as predefined).

2. Implementation
